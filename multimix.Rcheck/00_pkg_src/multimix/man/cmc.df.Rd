pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview.

\details{
The variables "age" (in years) and "nborn" (ranging from 0 to 16) would
normally be treated as continuous; "nborn" is skew and might well
be transformed. The remaining 8 variables are categorical. 

The variables "edu", "eduh" and "sol" take values "1,2,3,4", #' they are 
ordinal with 1 = low and 4 = high. The variable "husocc" takes the
same 4 values, but it is not clear if the order has any significance.

The variables "islam", "working", and "medex" are binary (9,1)-valued with
0=Non-Islam, 1=Islam for "islam";  0=Yes, 1=No for "working"; and 0=Good, 
1=Not good for "medex".

The variable "method" is ternary: 1=No-use, 2=Long-term, 3=Short-term.
