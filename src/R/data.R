#'Prostate cancer patient data
#'
#'This data set was considered in Byar and Green (1980) and reproduced in
#'Andrews and Herzberg (1985, pp 261â€“ 247).
#'
#'There are 12 pre-trial covariates measured on each patient, seven may be taken
#'to be continuous, four to be discrete, and one variable (\code{sg}) is an
#'index nearly all of whose values lie between 7 and 15, and which could be
#'considered either discrete or continuous. A preliminary inspection of the data
#'showed that the size of the primary tumour (\code{sz}) and serum prostatic
#'acid phosphatase (\code{ap}) were both skewed variables. These variables have
#'therefore been transformed. A square root transformation was used for
#'\code{sz}, and a logarithmic transformation was used for \code{ap} to achieve
#'approximate normality. (As for correlation, skewness over the whole data set
#'does not necessarily mean skewness within clusters but when clusters were
#'formed within-cluster skewness was observed for these variables.) Observations
#'that had missing values in any of the 12 pretreatment covariates were omitted
#'from further analysis, leaving 475 out of the original 506 observations
#'available.
